It’s been 83 days since the outbreak, still haven’t heard anything from Julia. Last time we talked was before shit really hit the fan, im getting worried. I need to know if Cici is okay. Meantime James is getting more testy than ever, put Harriet and her poor 8-year-old into “the brig” for asking one more pack of granola? This community is going to get overrun sooner or later if James doesn’t start making smarter choices, but no one really has the guts to challenge him, I guess no one wants the responsibilities as either. I Always hated how he called that shitty little cell “the brig”, 25 years in the marine CORP didn’t exactly make him  wise and calm i guess. Battery on my radio is getting low again, something tells me asking James access to the storage room again ain’t exactly smart, and I doubt there’s anymore batteries they can spare anyway. Think it’s time for me to leave.    Julia said she took all the kids in her class to a military outpost, Cici must be with her. But that was more than 2 month ago, anything could have happened. God please let her be alright. I need to make contact with Julia. Jesus, Last time I saw a Zed was before coming across James by the Tartan mart outside of Louisville, feels like a lifetime ago. Much as I like to bitch about James, he did take care of people. Anyways, I have to find some batteries for my walkie, Julia could reach out anytime.
